# Lab automation

This folder is optional. Delete it if this MicroHack does not need automated Azure provisioning.

When present, the MicroHack platform reads [lab-defaults.json](lab-defaults.json) to determine how to scope lab environments. It invokes [deploy-lab.ps1](deploy-lab.ps1) once per participant and [shared-deploy-lab.ps1](shared-deploy-lab.ps1) once per subscription before participant deployments begin.

## Folder layout

```text
labautomation/
|-- lab-defaults.json        # Platform-facing configuration
|-- deploy-lab.ps1           # Per-participant deployment hook + data seeding
|-- shared-deploy-lab.ps1    # Resource-provider registration (once per subscription)
|-- main.bicep               # Predictive Maintenance infrastructure
`-- get-keys.sh              # Participant-run script: resolves resource names/keys into a repo-root .env
```

## What `main.bicep` provisions

- Storage account with a `machine-wiki` blob container (knowledge base articles).
- Cosmos DB account (serverless) with the `FactoryOpsDB` database and its 10 containers
  (partition keys and the 30-day TTL on `Telemetry` match the source hack's seeding script).
- Azure AI Search, Microsoft Foundry account/project with the `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.4`, and
  `text-embedding-3-large` model deployments, and the AI Search/App Insights connections.
- API Management (`Machine API` and `Maintenance API`), including the inline XML policies that
  query Cosmos DB directly via APIM's managed identity — fully declarative, no post-deployment
  script needed for these two APIs.
- Container Registry and a Container Apps managed environment, for participants who choose the
  optional stretch goal in Challenge 5 (deploying the Aspire app as a container). No container app
  is pre-created; participants build and deploy their own image.
- Role assignments granting the participant (`userObjectId`) the data-plane access they need
  (Cosmos DB Data Contributor, Storage Blob Data Contributor, Foundry "Azure AI User") in addition
  to the subscription/resource-group Owner access the Hackbox platform already grants.

## Data seeding

Cosmos DB documents and the knowledge-base markdown files are **not** part of `main.bicep` — they
are actual data content, not infrastructure, so they can't be expressed declaratively. Instead,
`deploy-lab.ps1` seeds them automatically right after the Bicep deployment succeeds, using only
PowerShell and the `az` CLI (no bash, no Python):

- Cosmos DB documents: read from `data/*.json` at the hack root and inserted via signed Cosmos DB
  REST calls (HMAC-SHA256 over the account's primary key — the same authentication scheme the
  Cosmos SDKs use internally, reimplemented here in plain PowerShell).
- Knowledge base articles: uploaded from `data/kb-wiki/*.md` to the `machine-wiki` blob container
  via `az storage blob upload-batch`.

This means participants never need to run a manual seeding step — by the time they receive their
Hackbox credentials, the data is already loaded. `walkthrough/challenge-01/solution-01.md`
documents a manual fallback re-seed command in case this automatic step needs to be repeated.

## Authoring guidance

- Keep each participant deployment isolated.
- Put shared resources and one-time subscription preparation in `shared-deploy-lab.ps1`.
- Use `Get-MhhStableHash` when deterministic per-participant resource names are required.
- Return participant-facing values as `HackboxCredential` hashtables.
- Never return participant-specific secrets from the shared deployment hook.
