# Agentic AI Hacks | Predictive Maintenance

## Introduction

Manufacturing teams need to turn raw machine telemetry into fast, consistent
maintenance decisions. Manual triage is slow, root-cause analysis depends on
scattered historical knowledge, and coordinating parts, technicians, and
schedules across systems is hard to keep consistent.

This microhack builds an **agentic predictive maintenance workflow** for a
fictitious tire manufacturing company. You will implement five focused agents
that mirror a real maintenance process — from detecting an anomaly to
diagnosing its cause, planning the repair, scheduling a technician, and
ordering parts — using **Microsoft Agent Framework**, **Microsoft Foundry**,
and **Azure**.

During this microhack, you will build individual agent applications (mostly in
Python, with one in .NET), connect them to shared factory data, and finally
orchestrate them into a single observable workflow hosted in **.NET Aspire**.

## Scenario

This microhack uses a fictitious tire manufacturing company as an example, but
the scenario is applicable to most manufacturing environments where machines
are involved in production.

The image below illustrates the conceptual scenario.

![Manufacturing scenario](./challenges/images/maintenance-scenario.png)

❶ The factory operates a production line made up of multiple specialized
machines, each responsible for a distinct step in tire manufacturing (mixing,
extrusion, curing, inspection).

❷ A key business metric is **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)** — how
effectively equipment is utilized during planned production time. Unplanned
downtime and quality losses directly reduce throughput and profitability.

❸ Maintenance technicians perform both *planned* (time/usage-based)
maintenance and *condition-based* maintenance triggered by sensor readings and
detected anomalies. Because machines are complex, tasks require specific
skills, certifications, and safety procedures.

❹ Spare parts are held in a local warehouse with limited stock. When
inventory falls below thresholds or parts are needed for a repair,
replenishment is coordinated with external suppliers, often with lead times
and ordering constraints.

❺ The production environment integrates with multiple core systems (WMS, ERP,
CMMS, MES, QMS, knowledge bases). These systems coordinate production,
maintenance execution, inventory, quality, and scheduling — making end-to-end
orchestration essential.

The maintenance process is complex and requires coordination across people,
parts, and systems. Common challenges include:

* Detecting when a machine needs attention, who should be notified, and how
  to prioritize the response.
* Diagnosing the root cause of irregular machine behavior using telemetry
  plus shared knowledge and historical patterns.
* Determining which parts are required, whether they are in local stock, and
  how to handle supplier lead times.
* Matching work to technicians with the right skills, certifications, and
  safety requirements.
* Scheduling technicians based on availability, shifts, and constraints
  (access windows, downtime limits).
* Finding the optimal maintenance window that minimizes production
  disruption while keeping risk acceptable.

Agents can help by coordinating data, decisions, and handoffs across these
steps. The intent is not to replace technicians or planners, but to reduce
time-to-triage and make the workflow more consistent and observable.

The image below shows the agent roles used in this microhack and how they
interact with telemetry and existing factory systems.

![Agentic factory orchestration](./challenges/images/agentic-maintenance-orchestration.png)

❶ Telemetry is emitted from machine sensors and evaluated for deviations
(simple thresholds or an anomaly detection model).

❷ The **Anomaly Classification Agent** classifies the situation
(normal/warning/critical), enriches it with machine context, and raises an
alert with an appropriate priority.

❸ The **Fault Diagnosis Agent** proposes likely root causes using telemetry
plus documented historical knowledge (runbooks, prior work orders, technician
notes).

❹ The **Repair Planner Agent** translates a diagnosis into an actionable
repair plan — required parts, estimated effort, and required
skills/certifications — and drafts a work order for review.

❺ The **Maintenance Scheduler Agent** proposes a maintenance window based on
priority/risk, technician availability, and production constraints.

❻ The **Parts Ordering Agent** checks inventory and suggests replenishment
orders based on supplier lead times and constraints.

The factory process spans many systems, teams, and areas of responsibility.
This microhack embraces that reality: agents stay independent, but are
designed to collaborate through well-defined inputs/outputs and shared
observability.

## Architecture

You will build multiple agent applications (Python and .NET) and connect them
using a sequential workflow in the **Microsoft Agent Framework**. The workflow
itself is described in the scenario section above; the image below shows the
supporting platform components.

![Factory Hackathon Architecture](./challenges/images/hackathon-architecture.png)

❶ The documentation, starter code, and sample assets are available in this
repository, opened directly from your assigned lab account.

❷ **GitHub Codespaces** provides a containerized development environment with
the required tools and extensions pre-installed, so everyone starts from a
known baseline.

❸ You will build individual agent applications (mostly in Python, with one in
.NET) and eventually run the end-to-end workflow locally using **Aspire**,
which also gives you a single place to start the system and inspect service
logs.

❹ **GitHub Copilot** is used to co-develop parts of the solution — one
challenge uses it to build an agent from scratch — and you can use it
throughout the microhack for implementation, refactoring, and troubleshooting.

❺ Agents are registered in **Microsoft Foundry** and configured with the
selected model deployments plus the tools and data connections they need.

❻ **API Management** acts as an AI gateway for selected endpoints. When
needed, agents access those APIs via **MCP**, which provides a consistent
interface for tool calling.

❼ **Foundry IQ / knowledge sources** provide content for retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), such as machine documentation, troubleshooting guides, and
historical notes.

❽ Factory data (machines, thresholds, inventory, work orders) is stored in
**Cosmos DB** and **Blob Storage** and used by agents during analysis and
planning.

❾ **Application Insights** (and related logs/traces) provides observability
across the workflow so you can troubleshoot agent behavior, tool calls, and
end-to-end requests.

> [!NOTE]
> Manufacturing environments are complex: legacy systems, safety
> requirements, strict uptime targets, and processes that exist for good
> reasons — often split across distributed teams and both IT and OT domains.
>
> This microhack uses a deliberately simplified lab setup so you can focus on
> the learning objectives and the core patterns of agentic development
> (workflow design, tool integration, and observability), rather than the
> full complexity of factory networking, governance, and infrastructure.

## Challenges

This microhack is divided into five challenges, each building on the previous
one. You'll start by setting up your environment, then progressively build
individual agents, and finally orchestrate them into a complete workflow.

### Challenge structure

Each challenge follows a consistent structure:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🎯 **Objective** | Learning goals for the challenge |
| 🧭 **Context and Background** | Scenario explanation, architecture diagrams, and technical concepts |
| ✅ **Tasks** | Step-by-step instructions to complete the challenge |
| 🚀 **Go Further** | Optional stretch goals if you finish early |
| 🛠️ **Troubleshooting** | Common problems and solutions |
| 🧠 **Conclusion and Reflection** | Recap, key takeaways, and further reading |

Each challenge also includes a **"Stuck? See the walkthrough"** callout that
links to the matching `walkthrough/challenge-XX/solution-XX.md`, which adds
prerequisites, exact commands, expected results, troubleshooting, and a
validation checklist without repeating the challenge narrative.
